# Security

This document defines security reporting, handling, and disclosure information for the dev1-sg project and community.

## Reporting

We're very thankful for – and if desired happy to credit – security researchers and users who report vulnerabilities to the dev1-sg community.

To report a security issue directlly related to the dev1-sg project:

- Please email the private maintainers list <dev1-sg-maintainers@lists.dev1.sg> with the details.
- You may, but are not required to, encrypt your email to this list using the PGP keys of dev1-sg maintainers, listed below.
- You may choose if you want public acknowledgement of your effort and how you would like to be credited.

⚠️ If a vulnerability is for a specific project, tool or service in the wider dev1-sg ecosystem, please report directly to the security team for that specific project.

If you are unsure how to contact the security team for a specific project, you may send us a request for that info and we will do our best to help direct you.

Please do not report vulnerabily details for other projects to the dev1-sg maintainers.

## Handling

- All reports will be thoroughly investigated by the dev1-sg maintainers.
- Any vulnerability information shared with the dev1-sg maintainers will not be shared with others unless it is necessary to fix the issue.
  Information is shared only on a need to know basis.
- As the security issue moves through the identification and resolution process, the reporter will be notified.
- Additional questions about the vulnerability may also be asked of the reporter.

## Disclosures

Vulnerability disclosures will be listed as [GitHub Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories) on the appropriate dev1-sg repository and announced publicly.
Disclosures will contain an overview, details about the vulnerability, a fix that will typically be an update, and optionally a workaround if one is available.

We prefer to fully disclose a vulnerability as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available.
Disclosures will be published on the same day as a release fixing the vulnerability, after the release is published.
